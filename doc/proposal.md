# Project Proposal

The purpose of this project is to help a group or groups of people to find common times
when they are free to work. This would be done by having work groups and a user schedule.
A user may be someone working on a group project or trying to schedule a party for instance.

## Tech Stack

We will be making a web application. Our tech stack will consist of .NET technologies
including C#, Razor, and Bootstrap. We plan to use the MVC framework in 
Visual Studio. We will need to set up a SQL Server for storing user information.
We may decide to use extransous tools like Entity Framework for the database.

## Features

Users would have a login so pertinent information could be saved. Users will have access to 
making and joining groups of other users that they would like to schedule time with. There will be
options to create and edit your personal schedule while including information like drive times.
With time allowing, we plan to add additional embellishments. This could include something like
the ability to create a specific meeting construct with a location, time, notifications/reminders, 
and response functionality.

## External Technologies

We are going to look in to using some external technologies like Google Calendars. We need to check for
an API and research its utility for our specific task. We will consider the possibility of also using
an SMS service to allow group members to message each other.

## Example Use

A simple example might be two people finding a time to meet about something. Both users would have their schedule
saved to their account. They would join a group together and navigate to a page that displays free time in common.
They then may agree on a time and set it as a meeting construct that they can both respond to with confirmation of
their intentions to come.
